        <p>India’s independence in 1947 was the result of countless sacrifices and relentless efforts made by visionary leaders and revolutionaries. Here’s a look at the most influential freedom fighters and how they shaped the nation's destiny.</p>

        <h3>🕊️ Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
        <p>Known as the "Father of the Nation," Gandhi led India’s freedom movement with the philosophy of non-violence (Ahimsa) and civil disobedience. He led iconic movements like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Non-Cooperation Movement (1920)</li>
          <li>Dandi March (1930)</li>
          <li>Quit India Movement (1942)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔥 Bhagat Singh</h3>
        <p>A fearless revolutionary, Bhagat Singh became a national icon after he was executed at the age of 23. His actions, like throwing a bomb in the Central Assembly and his writings, inspired youth to fight for freedom.</p>

        <h3>🪖 Subhas Chandra Bose</h3>
        <p>Popularly known as "Netaji," Bose believed in armed resistance. He formed the <strong>Indian National Army (INA)</strong> and gave the slogan: <strong>"Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom."</strong></p>

        <h3>📜 Jawaharlal Nehru</h3>
        <p>India’s first Prime Minister, Nehru played a significant role in international diplomacy and in spreading the vision of a free, democratic India. He worked closely with Gandhi and was a key leader in the Congress Party.</p>

        <h3>👩 Rani Lakshmibai</h3>
        <p>The Queen of Jhansi was a brave warrior during the First War of Independence in 1857. She became a symbol of resistance to British rule and is remembered for her heroism and valor in battle.</p>

        <h3>📣 Bal Gangadhar Tilak</h3>
        <p>Tilak was one of the earliest nationalist leaders who declared, “Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it.” He inspired masses and strongly opposed British rule through his writings and speeches.</p>

        <h3>📚 Other Notable Freedom Fighters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel – Unified India post-independence</li>
          <li>Lala Lajpat Rai – Led protests against British reforms</li>
          <li>Chandrashekhar Azad – A revolutionary mentor of Bhagat Singh</li>
          <li>Annie Besant – Irish lady who supported Indian self-rule</li>
          <li>Dr. B. R. Ambedkar – Drafted the Indian Constitution</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📝 Conclusion</h3>
        <p>These heroes were not just freedom fighters; they were visionaries who laid the foundation of modern India. Their courage and patriotism continue to inspire generations. We salute their legacy and sacrifice.</p>
